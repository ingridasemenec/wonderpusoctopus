# Modeling the relationship between biogeochemical layers and chlorophyll density  

Prediction of chlorophyll concentration in the ocean aids in assessing ecosystem health, advising fisheries management, and enhancing our understanding of Earth's biogeochemical processes. By employing deep learning methods, we will develop models to analyze the relationship between chlorophyll concentration and biogeochemical features using the [Copernicus Marine Dataset](https://www.copernicus.eu/en).

## Overview:
Chlorophyll concentration in the ocean reflects the interaction of factors like nutrient availability and sunlight, influencing oceanic biomass productivity. High chlorophyll levels suggest nutrient-rich waters where phytoplankton, the ocean's primary producers, thrive, which in turn impacts fishery population dynamics and ecosystem health. Additionaly, from chlorophyll patterns we can gain insight about climate change, ocean currents and mixing processes. A predictive and/or explanatory analysis using machine and deep learning models will be helpful in addressing these environmental challenges.

The project goals are:
- What environmental, biogeochemical, climatic features affect chlorophyll levels?
- Determine if the available data can predict impacts on fisheries, enabling policymakers to better prepare and respond. (we can take this out, not sure if we are gonna do this for now!)

## Stakeholders:
NOAA, Fish and Wildlife Department, local fisheries, coastal communities.
## KPI:
Predicting/Forecasting chlorophyll levels accurately.
